\usage{
avgLinesPerFile(dirPath, fileTypes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirPath}{Character string specifying the path to the directory.}

\item{fileTypes}{Optional character vector specifying which file types to consider.
If NULL (the default), all file types are considered.}
}

A tibble with one row for each file type and columns for the file type and average number of lines.

\description{
This function calculates the average number of lines for each file type in a specified directory.
The number of lines is only calculated for file types that are text-based (e.g., .txt, .csv, .R).
For binary file types, the number of lines cannot be computed and the function returns NA.
